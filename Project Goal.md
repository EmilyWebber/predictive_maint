# Project Goal

To be the ultimate machine whisperers. Save our company millions (or perhaps billions) of dollars by being able to forcast and predict failures before they actually happen.

# Datasets

- NASA Turbofan Engine Fault Dataset: https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#turbofan
  - Unit Number
  - Time in Cycles
  - Operational Settings
  - Sensor Measurements

# Modeling Strategy
- Using the provided dataset, we can solve the problem by getting the following:
 - How many more cycles a turbofan has until failure
 - Will this turbofan fail within X cycles?
 - Will this fan fail within a certain timeframe?


# End Goal
